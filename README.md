### About Me
Hi, I'm Cory. I'm a currently a computer science student at California Baptist University going into my senior year. I have been interested in computers and programming for a long time now (I remember in middle school learning the basics of Java!).

Near the end of my junior year of college, I had concluded a semester of working hard in React Native for a design project, and I had such a great time I decided to specialize in web development: specifically front-end, but I am hoping to transition to full stack at some point! So in May I started working through the [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com) in order to become as proficient as I could in HTML, CSS, Javascript and React, and am continuing to work through their curriculum building cool projects along the way.

### Currently Working On
